#Overview
This Python project presents a comprehensive Library simulator, featuring multiple classes for LibraryItem, Patron, and Library. Additionally, it includes three specialized subclasses (Book, Album, Movie) that inherit from LibraryItem, providing a versatile and extensible solution for simulating library operations.

#Key Features
Object-Oriented Design: The project showcases a well-structured object-oriented design, with distinct classes and subclasses, promoting code modularity and maintainability.

Encapsulation: Private data members are implemented, and access is controlled through carefully designed get and set methods, adhering to industry-standard naming conventions.

Extensive Testing: The implemented functions have undergone rigorous testing to ensure robustness and adherence to specifications. Various scenarios, including item checkouts, returns, requests, and fine management, have been thoroughly examined.
